# EDA-Clustering-Predicting-Churn
Perform unsupervised clustering of customers (such as K-Means) and use machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to build predictive models. By learning patterns from labeled data, it is possible to predict whether customers are likely to churn in the future.
